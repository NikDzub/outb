How does real time bidding work?
the rtb starts with the user, when u click a link to go to a website rtb begins.
b4 the page loads the sites publisher sends avialable ad space dimensions to the SSP 
then the SSP looks at ur cookies to get data on web activity,intersts location and more.. 
this data helps determine what ad would be relevant to the user. 
next, the DSP assigns a value to the user and places a bid on the ad space based on that data. 
finnaly, the SSP recives the bids and picks a winner based on the highest/relevant bid. 
once an ad gets chosen the website loads, showing the winning ad on ur screen.
